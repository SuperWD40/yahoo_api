A python library to scrape Yahoo!Â Finance

This library enables users to independently collect financial data from Yahoo! Finance, thereby eliminating the need for third-party data providers. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the data collection process, saving valuable time and effort. Whether you are an individual investor, financial analyst, or a developer, this library is an essential tool that can help you stay ahead of the competition.

I want this library easy as possible to use. Most of methods of this library are called like Yahoo! Finance's Webpages. 
For example: if you want infos about apple available on the appple's statistics web page you just have to run: yahoo_finance.ticker('AAPL').statistics()

Here is the documentation of the library: https://medium.com/@matteo.bernard/get-an-assets-history-quickly-and-easily-f377eee093e1
