A python library to scrape Yahoo!Â Finance

This library enables users to independently collect financial data from Yahoo! Finance, thereby eliminating the need for third-party data providers. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the data collection process, saving valuable time and effort. 

I want this library easy as possible to use. Most of methods of this library are called like Yahoo! Finance's Webpages.
